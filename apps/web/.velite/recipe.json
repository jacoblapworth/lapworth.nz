Diamond Crystal or 1 Tbsp. Morton kosher salt and mix with a rubber spatula until a shaggy dough forms and no dry streaks remain.</li>\n<li>Pour 4 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil into a big bowl that will fit in your refrigerator. This puppy is going to rise! Transfer dough to bowl and turn to coat in oil. Cover with a silicone lid or plastic wrap and chill until dough is doubled in size (it should look very bubbly and alive), at least 8 hours and up to 1 day. If you're in a rush, you can also let it rise at room temperature until doubled in size, 3–4 hours.</li>\n<li>Generously butter a 13x9\" baking pan, for thicker focaccia that’s perfect for sandwiches, or an 18x13\" rimmed baking sheet, for focaccia that's thinner, crispier, and great for snacking. The butter may seem superfluous, but it’ll ensure that your focaccia doesn’t stick. Pour 1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil into center of pan. Keeping the dough in the bowl and using a fork in each hand, gather up edges of dough farthest from you and lift up and over into center of bowl. Give the bowl a quarter turn and repeat process. Do this 2 more times; you want to deflate dough while you form it into a rough ball. (We learned this technique from Alexandra Stafford, who uses it to shape her no-knead bread.) Transfer dough to prepared pan. Pour any oil left in bowl over and turn dough to coat it in oil. Let rise, uncovered, in a dry, warm spot (like near a radiator or on top of the fridge or a preheating oven) until doubled in size, at least 1½ hours and up to 4 hours.</li>\n<li>Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 450°. To see if the dough is ready, poke it with your finger. It should spring back slowly, leaving a small visible indentation. If it springs back quickly, the dough isn’t ready. (If at this point the dough is ready to bake but you aren’t, you can chill it up to 1 hour.) Lightly oil your hands. If using a rimmed baking sheet, gently stretch out dough to fill (you probably won't need to do this if using a baking pan). Dimple focaccia all over with your fingers, like you’re aggressively playing the piano, creating very deep depressions in the dough (reach your fingers all the way to the bottom of the pan). Drizzle with remaining 1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil and sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Bake focaccia until puffed and golden brown all over, 20–30 minutes.</li>\n<li>Hold off on this last step until you're ready to serve the focaccia: Melt 4 Tbsp. unsalted butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat. Peel and grate in 2–4 garlic cloves with a Microplane (use 2 cloves if you’re garlic-shy or up to 4 if you love it). Return to medium heat and cook, stirring often, until garlic is just lightly toasted, 30–45 seconds. (Or, if you prefer raw garlic to toasted garlic, you can grate the garlic into the hot butter, off heat, then brush right away.)</li>\n<li>Brush garlic-butter all over focaccia and slice into squares or rectangles.</li>\n<li>Do Ahead: Focaccia is best eaten the day it's made, but keeps well in the freezer. Slice it into pieces, store it in a freezer-safe container, then reheat it on a baking sheet in a 300° F oven.</li>\n</ol>"

    "content": "<p>Roasted squash — butter, lemon, cream sauce — almond praline and crispy sage leaves. Veggies drenched in fat and flavour are always delicious, a sweet and savoury explosion. The hasselbacked squash provides crevices for the maple glaze to caramelise and the sauce is a classic French beurre blanc, but with some curry powder to give it a little kick. Garnished with almond praline and crispy sage leaves gives a nice crunchy contrast to the soft squash.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/static/1-3499ae.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of hasselbacked butternut squash on plate with creamed sauce\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/static/2-c5cabd.jpg\" alt=\"Closeup of the hasselbacked cuts of the butternut squash\">\n<img src=\"/static/3-220a50.jpg\" alt=\"Overhead photo of hasselbacked butternut squash on plate with creamed sauce\">\n<img src=\"/static/4-3fd367.jpg\" alt=\"Closeup photo of the French beurre blanc sauce, butter and cream separated\"></p>\n<h2>Ingredients</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>1 whole butternut squash</li>\n<li>3 tbsp. butter</li>\n<li>2 sprigs of sage</li>\n<li>1/4 cup maple syrup</li>\n<li>2 tbsp. apple cider vinegar</li>\n<li>Pinch of chilli powder</li>\n<li>1/2 cup chopped almonds</li>\n<li>80g butter</li>\n<li>1/2 chopped shallot</li>\n<li>1 tsp. yellow mustard powder</li>\n<li>Salt &#x26; black pepper</li>\n<li>1 tsp. curry powder</li>\n<li>Chopped parsley</li>\n<li>Thyme sprigs</li>\n<li>2 tsp. lemon juice</li>\n<li>100 ml cream</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Instructions</h2>\n<h3>Squash</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Preheat oven to 200ºC.</li>\n<li>Peel and slit the squash lengthwise, removing the seeds and cleaning the cavity. Rub with olive oil, season with salt and pepper and bake for 15 mins.</li>\n<li>Meanwhile, melt 3 tbsp. butter in a pan, then add sprigs of sage. Once it sizzles, add 1/4 cup maple syrup and 2 tbsp. apple cider vinegar and a pinch of chilli powder. Once this thickens to a glaze consistency and coats the back of a spoon, remove it from the heat. Remove the sage sprigs and keep for garnishing. Reserve some of the glaze for the praline.</li>\n<li>Take the squash out and let it cool.

The chopsticks prevent the knife from cutting all the way and keep the bottom part of the squash intact for support.</li>\n<li>Brush the hasselbacked squash with the maple glaze, and pour the rest of the glaze freely.

Cook until the glaze thickens and coats the almonds. Spread the almonds on a baking sheet and bake at 180ºC for 10 mins. Let it cool and then break it up into pieces.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Sauce</h3>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>In a non stick pan place 80g butter, 1/2 chopped shallot, 1 tsp. yellow mustard powder, some black pepper, salt and 1 tsp. curry powder. Sauté until the butter foams and then clarify by separating the solids. Add the chopped parsley and thyme sprigs, then stir in 2 tsp, lemon juice and 100 ml cream.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Serve</h3>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>Place the squash on a flat plate and pour the sauce around it. Garnish with the praline and crispy sage leaves.</li>\n</ol>"

Using your fingers, rub the lavender into the sugar, releasing the oils and fragrance. You may notice the sugar goes slightly purple. You want to break down the lavender as much as possible here. Take your time with it, it’s quite satisfying and you’ll enjoy a bit of aromatherapy while you’re there.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In a medium sized saucepan (big enough to comfortably fit a litre of curd), combine eggs, yolks, lemon juice, sugar and lavender, whisking over a low heat until combined and sugar completely dissolves.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add in butter, one cube at a time and using a wooden spoon, stir constantly between each addition, waiting for each cube to melt fully. Continue stirring after all butter is added, until it’s thickened well. The curd should coat the back of the wooden spoon.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Strain the curd through a sieve to remove any blobs of egg and lavender buds. Set aside to cool. It will continue thickening as it cools. If making ahead, place in an airtight container or jar in the fridge.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Base</h3>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>\n<p>For the base, preheat oven to 180 C.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Combine all dry ingredients in a medium sized mixing bowl. Melt butter and combine with dry ingredients.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Into a tart tin with a loose base (approximately 24cm diameter), use your fingers or the bottom of a cup to press the mixture into the base and up the sides as evenly as possible.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bake in the oven for 15-18 minutes until golden. Be careful here because it can go from golden to burnt pretty quickly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Remove from oven and leave to cool in tin. Once cool enough, I like to refrigerate the base for 30-60 minutes to help make it a little less fragile for removing it from the tin.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once cooled, remove from tin and fill with cooled curd. Pull apart the buds from your remaining lavender and sprinkle over the top, a little lemon zest is nice on here too.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I like to refrigerate the tart, now that’s it has been assembled, for a few hours before serving so that the curd gets to know it’s new home (the tart shell) well.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<p>The lemon tree that hangs over my fence is laden with fruit at the moment. I always feel so lucky to get fruit and vegetables straight from their plant. Feels like such a gift, much more satisfying than a shop. This curd uses quite a few eggs, so it’s perfect if you’ve got plenty to use up or if you have little egg laying chickens. I use fresh lavender from my garden in this, but you could use dried lavender too. Lemon can be easily swapped for any citrus, so don’t be shy to play around with it. My only recommendation is that if you choose to use a less tart citrus like orange or blood orange, mix it with some lemon juice so you don’t lose the tang.\nI had a funny realisation the last time I was making curd that it’s kind of like a sweet mayonnaise - which I just find so funny but also interesting. The realisation really helped me to understand what was happening in the process of making curd, which is just emulsification, really, like mayo or aioli. You start with eggs and acid, and slowly add fat (butter, in curds case) until it thickens. I think with tarts, and pies, and desserts in general, we tend to get a bit hung up on the perfection of it all, but I really, really like an imperfect dessert. I think they taste better, they look better, there’s more room for an ‘imperfect’ amount of gooey oozy curd which is just lost with a perfectly gelatinous slice of lemon tart, which of course has it’s place, but not in my kitchen. I love the way a soft tart filling oozes out once it’s sliced into, and the way that texture works with the crumbly biscuit base is just divine! So enjoy, let go of perfection and have fun!</p>"
