Design involves problem-solving, storytelling, and the development of
engaging experiences that go beyond aesthetic appeal, all of which are
critical elements. Constructing a unified Design System heavily relies
on the establishment of design principles.

To ensure an outstanding user experience for Xero's customers, we
collaborated with cross-disciplinary teams to co-create the Experience
Design Principles. Our aim was to create a comprehensive set of
principles that would guide our teams day-to-day design decisions.
