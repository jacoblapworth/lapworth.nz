![Design System for Xero](xui-cover.png)

XUI (Xero User Interface) is Xero's design system, created to ensure a consistent and cohesive user experience across all Xero products. It provides a comprehensive set of design principles, guidelines, reusable components and patterns that empower designers and developers to focus on solving customer problems while maintaining brand integrity.

XUI is not just a component library; it's a living system that evolves with Xero's needs. It fosters collaboration between cross-functional teams, enabling them to build high-quality products faster and more efficiently.

- 120+ components
- Built with React, TypeScript and SASS
- Figma library
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessible
- Responsive
- Design tokens for colors, typography, spacing, and more
- Documentation for designers and developers
- Community contribution model

## Figma Plugin

Onboarding to a new design system can be a daunting task, unfamiliar names and different component patterns can be difficult to pick up. We wanted the experience to be as seamless as possible, promoting discovery of components and best practices.
We integrated XUI's Figma library directly into the plugin so that when someone selects a XUI component, they can see the documentation for that component without searching.
