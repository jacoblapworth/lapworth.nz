Tables are a fundamental component in many software applications, especially in data-intensive platforms like Xero. They provide a structured way to present large amounts of information, allowing users to easily scan, compare, and
interact with datasets within Xero.

## Principles

{/* - Empower users to manage their own data
- Provide clear and concise information at a glance
- Ensure a consistent and intuitive user experience */}

1. **Reliably familiar**
Tables maintain consistent patterns, interactions, and visual language across all experiences.
Users seamlessly apply knowledge between different tables without needing to relearn the pattern â€“ creating an intuitive and unified product experience.
2. **Right-sized functionality**
Modular table architecture delivers precisely the functionality each scenario requires nothing more, nothing less. This eliminates interface bloat, enhances performance, and enables rapid development of tailored solutions.
3. **Personalisation over configuration**
Empower customers to personalise tables for their specific needs. Starting with good defaults, we enable users to create their own views, saving time and increasing efficiency by focusing on what's most relevant to them.

## Redesign

The redesigned tables focus on improving usability, accessibility, and visual clarity. Key features include:
- Enhanced readability with improved typography and spacing
- Advanced filtering and sorting options
- Bulk actions for efficient data management
- Inline editing capabilities for quick updates
- Maintaining the same density to display more data on screen

### Filtering and sorting

A large focus of the redesign was to empower customers to quickly find and act on the data they need.

This required us to completely re-evaluate how we present tabular data. We introduced a core principle to: *present only a single piece of data per column.*
This allowed us to provide more relevant filtering and sorting options.
