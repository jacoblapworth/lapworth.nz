Tables are a fundamental component in many software applications, especially in data-intensive platforms like Xero. They provide a structured way to present large amounts of information, allowing users to easily scan, compare, and
interact with datasets within Xero.

### Filtering and sorting

A large focus of the redesign was to empower customers to quickly find and act on the data they need. 

This required us to completely re-evaluate how we present tabular data. We introduced a core principle of singular data types per column, allowing us to provide more relevant filtering and sorting options.
