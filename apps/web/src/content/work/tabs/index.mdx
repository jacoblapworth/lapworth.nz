Houston is the name of the design system at Vend — “Houston we have a problem”. We’ve been working on Houston for a few years now, and it’s been a really interesting journey. We’ve had to deal with a lot of challenges, and I think we’ve come out the other side with a really solid foundation. I’m going to walk you through some of the challenges we’ve faced, and how we’ve dealt with them.

Here’s what our design documentation actually looks like. This is a snippet of part of our tabs docs.

We also curate in-context designs. These help future designers understand how to use a component, but also help during design to “road-test” the component.

## The problem

When our tabs were initially designed and developed, we hadn’t anticipated them being used with so much content. The component essentially visually breaks, the pattern no longer “makes sense”. New uses push designs forward. The reason I chose to walk you through a case study of a component that already exists, is that this feels like a much more common scenario, especially within a mature design system. A lot of the time we’re not working from scratch, we’re building on top of what’s there, leveraging existing patterns, and questioning design decisions.

## Establishing a case for a new/changed component

- Are we just using tabs “wrong”?
- Are there other patterns for dealing with this kind of content?
- Need to look at the problem in the context of the business & product.

Business focus – why is supporting something like this important? One of the reasons I can assume that we didn’t anticipate this overflow problem, is when we looked at the original use cases, the core customer for Vend was smaller. Because of the small size of the team, we take quite a pragmatic approach to defining scope. We don’t worry about things that don’t bring value to our customers. Don’t create deviations of components unless you actually have to. Very frequently we thought we might need variations of a component but by continually denying ourselves the option we realised that we either didn’t need them at all, or could find a different solution to the problem for which we were about to create a variation. Vend has started to look more closely at it’s unit economics, and what sort of customer “fits” and is profitable for us. As we focus on larger customers, the product has to grow to cater more towards them. Larger customers = more locations, more complex needs, in general more of everything.

Working on another project we ran into this issue again. We’d started exploring how third-party add-ons would be surfaced within the product. How do we attach and attribute extra metadata to entities in Vend? We were pretty sold on this approach This raises the issue of, we no longer have control over the content

One of the reasons we take such a pragmatic approach is because we see the design system as a contract between dev & design. We agree to design within these boundaries, and engineering is able to reduce complexity and effort. This comes about because of our team structure. It’s ad-hoc in nature, dealing with issues as they arise and impact work. The concept of YAGNI is pretty pragmatic in the way we deal value and effort. In the past we’ve been bitten by projects that have ballooned and been delayed by over-engineering and under estimation. Sometimes good is good enough. How do we slice small, so that we can deliver value at every step of the way, understanding the risks, and measuring the return on investment

## Interrogating the original purpose

Tabs are used in a group as page or section controls, each representing a page or section of a page that is a sibling of each other. Only one tab is active at a time, displaying its content while hiding that of other tabs.

Words before pixels. It’s so much easier Speak the same language. Of all the other benefits, design systems increase the efficiency of different teams working together, simply, because it unifies the language that the two teams are using. I have a real interest in semantics. What we call something has so much impact on how we can use something. Having clear names can

Tabs can function as a tertiary form of navigation. We can start to also critique the current rationale: should tabs include user generated content? We start questioning whether

If we take that same visual language and apply it to the tabs, our users know to scroll. One thing we’re very averse to doing at Vend is truncating content. We think that we should respect our users’ content – this goes into a larger topic of dealing with edge cases. A lot of our product is desktop based, based on a retailer’s jobs-to-be done. At times we’ve chosen not to invest in supporting mobile. A lot of our components and designs going forward do work at these breakpoints, but following that rule of YAGNI, we think sometimes there is more valuable work we could be doing. At a systems level, i still think it’s really valuable that we invest the time – enabling us to scale in the future. Here, it also greatly exaggerates the issue at hand.

Another approach we took, was to create some sort of overflow menu. This spurred a lot of questions. – What lives in the popover, and what lives in the tabs? – Is it static or dynamic? – How complex is this to build? Watching the viewport size. – This still seems to break on mobile

<Image src="exploration-overflow-start.png" alt="" />

We then started to question if a tab could start to function by itself. In our visual system an active tab isn’t interactive. We use our green across the product to indicate state. Could tabs become just an indicator for the current page, leaving all navigation to the overflow? – if we look back to the original intention of tabs, this seems like a step too far – just because we can, doesn’t mean we should – from a development perspective this also seems like it could be complex Would we never show all the tabs? Do it dynamically depending on the viewport? The mobile breakpoint really highlights this, we still run into overflow issues with a long name. This is also where the gold started to appear. If we combine this dropdown with the overflow shadow, could a user scroll through all tabs, not just the active one?

We start to combine some of these concepts into something that appears to deal with the problem at hand, while also respecting the current implementation. We’d recognised earlier that scrolling horizontally on a small touch area might be an issue. So we started to revisit that core definition of what tabs are. Both a navigation element, but also an indicator for current location. We can then question if we can split those functions. The tabs maintain the visual indicator for place, but the button becomes the function for navigation. With this focus we can look closer at the overflow button.

The popover naturally becomes a translation of the tab bar, but vertically. So many of the questions we had earlier about when and which content to show become answered with this approach. With those functions defined earlier we can start talking to them. If I navigate to an item hidden in the tabbar, from the overflow, what should happen?

<Image src="exploration-example.png" alt="" />

This is where we can start to see how this new overflow component can scale, with existing components. We already have patterns for dealing with finding something in a list. Say you have 30 outlets across the states,{' '}

During this time, we’re road-testing the components in-situ across the product. We realised that when the tabs serve a navigation role as opposed to filters, “All” might not be the best name for the collection of tabs – considering what a user is looking for.
