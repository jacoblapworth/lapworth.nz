A reimagined navigation and homepage experience

> Get a clearer view of business performance quickly with new widgets that highlight what needs your attention. The tailored view helps you stay focused on what matters most and take common actions directly from the page. For example, the new task list helps you prioritise and take prompt action on outstanding invoices and bills, and the enhanced banking widget shows where you have a balance difference and should complete a bank reconciliation
