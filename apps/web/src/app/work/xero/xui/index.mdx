## Adoption & impact

XUI is widely adopted across Xero's product suite, with every new feature and product utilizing the design system. XUI is used by over 100 product teams with 120+ designers and 1,000+ developers. This adoption has led to significant improvements in development speed, consistency, and user satisfaction. Teams have reported an 80% reduction in time to ship new features, allowing them to focus more on innovation and customer needs.

## Figma Plugin

Onboarding to a new design system can be a daunting task, unfamiliar names and different component patterns can be difficult to pick up. We wanted the experience to be as seamless as possible, promoting discovery of components and best practices.
We integrated XUI's Figma library directly into the plugin so that when someone selects a XUI component, they can see the documentation for that component without searching.
